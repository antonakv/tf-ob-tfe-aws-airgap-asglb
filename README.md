## Amazon AWS Resources diagram

 ![Diagram](https://github.com/antonakv/tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb/raw/main/diagram/diagram.png)

## Preparation 

- Clone git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonakv/tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb.git
```

- Change folder to tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb

```bash
cd tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb
```

- Create file testing.tfvars with following contents

```
key_name         = "NameOfYourEC2Keypair"
ami              = "ami-0a3ca16f3cf729915" # Private AMI prepared for the TFE installation
instance_type    = "t3.large"
db_instance_type = "db.t3.medium"
region           = "eu-central-1"
cidr_vpc         = "10.5.0.0/16"
cidr_subnet1     = "10.5.1.0/24"
cidr_subnet2     = "10.5.2.0/24"
cidr_subnet3     = "10.5.3.0/24"
cidr_subnet4     = "10.5.4.0/24"
db_password      = "PutYourValueHere"
enc_password     = "PutYourValueHere"
tfe_hostname     = "tfe5.myname.hashicorp-success.com"
```

- Change folder to `pre-req`

- Follow `pre-req/README.md` manual to prepare assets on Amazon S3 required for the installation

- Change folder to Git repository root

`cd ..`

- run `terraform init`

- run `terraform apply`

## Usage

- Wait about 5-10 minutes until Terraform Enterprise instances are up and running and 502 Error code is not displayed

- Open the URL `https://tfe5.myname.hashicorp-success.com:8800/` in a web browser

- Expected result:

![TFE login page](https://github.com/antonakv/tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb/raw/main/images/tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb-1.png)

- Enter password ```Password1#``` and click ```Unlock```

- Expected result:

 ![Unlock](https://github.com/antonakv/tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb/raw/main/images/tf-ob-tfe-aws-airgap-asglb-2.png)

- Click on `Dashboard`

- Expected result:

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

- Run `terraform apply`

```
$ terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # (config refers to values not yet known)
